**«Мои объявления» has rows.** The dashboard's biggest named hole, closed at both ends.

`GET /listings/` answers `published()` and takes no owner parameter, so a seller's own DRAFTS were unreachable by any call the contract offered. This pair recorded the gap rather than papering over it — an injected `MyListingsSource`, and a NAMED failure when a host had not wired one, because "we cannot ask" and "you have no listings" are different sentences. **stapel-listings 0.7.0** answers it with `GET my/listings/`: the caller's own rows in every status, `?status=` for a set, the same `IDAnchorPagination` envelope the other two owner reads use. The pin moves `v0.6.1 → v0.7.0` and the generated surfaces with it (13 paths, 64 error codes).

- **`ListingsApi.myListings(params)`** — one keyset page of the caller's own listings. `params.status` is a SET of lifecycle statuses (a dashboard tab is one), sent as a single comma-separated value; omit it for all nine.
- **`defaultMyListingsSource(api)`** is what `useMyListings` runs on now, narrowed per tab from `MY_LISTINGS_TAB_STATUSES` — the SERVER's own groupings, so a tab's rows and its `my/counters` badge cannot describe different sets. `MyListingsSource` survives as a seam for a deployment that keeps its rows elsewhere.
- **`MyListingCard` / `PaginatedMyListingCards`** — the owner's row: the public card plus `moderation_status` and the `*_draft` twins. The pane no longer passes `"approved"` as a stand-in for the second axis, so a LIVE listing whose edit is under review finally says so on the dashboard — the one combination 0.5.0 made possible and `status` alone cannot express.
- **`model/mine.ts`** (`myListingTitle` / `myListingPrice` / `myListingImages` / `showsDraft`) — the published value when there is one, the draft twin otherwise, in one place. Without it the drafts tab is a column of blank rows: `title`/`price`/`images` are the PUBLISHED fields and stay empty until a publish promotes them. A row showing its draft says which it is showing.
- **`MY_LISTINGS_UNTABBED_STATUSES`** and a takedown block above the tabs. `blocked` is counted by `my/counters` in no tab at all, so folding it into one would make a badge and its rows disagree and leaving it out would hide the listing whose owner most needs to know. The pane fetches it beside the tabs; "no takedowns" and "we could not check" are told apart.
- **Per-tab empty states** — "no drafts" and "nothing sold yet" are different sentences.
- Every status-moving write now invalidates the owner's ROWS as well as the counters (`listingsQueryKeys.allMine()`); invalidating one and not the other is the shape of the bug where the badge says 2 and the tab shows 3.

**Breaking (0.x minor):** `MY_LISTINGS_SOURCE_MISSING` and the `listings.mine.source_missing` i18n key are **removed**. There is no failure state left to name — a missing source is no longer possible — and keeping the export would have been a comment about something that no longer happens. `useMyListings().rows` is likewise never `failed` for a wiring reason; `MyListingsBag` gains `blockedRows`.

The 0.6.1 → 0.7.0 span also carries 0.6.2's two authorization fixes, which retire upstream asks 3 and 4: `PUT`/`PATCH` now pass `_get_own`, and `GET /{pk}/` resolves through `visible_to`, so a stranger's draft 404s instead of answering 200. The pair's `publiclyVisible` report stays — it is now addressed at the one reader who still reaches an unpublished listing there, its owner.
